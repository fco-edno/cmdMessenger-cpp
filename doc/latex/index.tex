The Cmd\+Messenger is a messaging library for the Arduino platform. To use the Cmd\+Messenger, a list of command identifiers is defined and then, callbacks are attached for the received messages. The message format is as it follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
  cmdID,arg1,arg2,...,argn;
\end{DoxyPre}
\hypertarget{index_this_project}{}\section{What is this project all about?}\label{index_this_project}
This is simply an implementation of such messaging protocol for the pc side, built in a cross-\/platform C++. It uses the Serial Library for its communication, this library provides total control over Timeouts and it is cross-\/platform. The official project of the Cmd\+Messenger provides a full C\# implementation that runs in both Mono and Visual Studio.\hypertarget{index_getting_started}{}\section{Getting Started}\label{index_getting_started}
Take a look at the main class documentation cmd\+::\+Cmd\+Messenger and the command classes cmd\+::\+Cmd\+Received cmd\+::\+Cmd\+Send

Take a look at this simple example led.\+cpp\hypertarget{index_features}{}\section{Features}\label{index_features}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Total control over Timeouts trough the Serial Library project.
\item Send and receive ascii commands.
\item Clean A\+P\+I with overloaded operators.
\item Set methods or global functions as callbacks.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_problems}{}\section{Problems}\label{index_problems}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Does not send or receive binary data.
\item Parsers safety and efficiency needs to be improved.
\item It's written in cross-\/platform C++, but the project lacks support for other platforms rather than linux.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_install}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install}
\begin{DoxyRefDesc}{Todo}
\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000001}{Todo}]Write the install section 

Remember to find a way to ship all dependecies in one package \end{DoxyRefDesc}
